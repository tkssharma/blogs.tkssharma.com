*   Express/Nest JS with Typescript with ORM (TypeORM, knex, Prisma)
*   Deploying Services with AWS CDK Constructs with RDS/Dynamodb
*   Building Different Microservice Architecture
*   Using Event-Driven Arch, CQRS, Event Sourcing based Arch
*   Deploying services using AWS ECS or Lambda using AWS CDK

Here are some common microservices architecture patterns and best practices when using Node.js:

1.  Single Service Microservice Architecture:
2.  Layered Microservice Architecture:
3.  Event-Driven Microservice Architecture:
4.  API Gateway Microservice Architecture:
5.  Service Mesh Microservice Architecture:
6.  Serverless Microservices
7.  Containerized Microservices:
8.  Event Sourcing and CQRS:
9.  BFF (Backend For Frontend) Microservice Architecture:
10.  Database Microservice Architecture:
