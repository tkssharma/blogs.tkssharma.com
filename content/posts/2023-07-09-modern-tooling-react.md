Ecosystem of React JS IN 2024
==============================


As React celebrates its 10th anniversary in 2023, the ecosystem continues to flourish with constant advancements and innovations. As one of the most widely-used JavaScript libraries, React remains a favorite among developers for building dynamic and high-performance applications.

However, with a vast array of tools and libraries available within the React ecosystem, choosing the right combination for your project can be challenging. In this article, we'll explore the most essential libraries that are widely used and trusted by developers, and help you make informed decisions on the right tools to use for your next React project.

Getting started with React
---------------------------

For those who are new to React, getting started can be a daunting task. There are a few different ways to get started which can be confusing.

CodeSandbox and Stackblitz
---------------------------

If you're new to React, or if you just want to play around with it without setting up a project, you can use online sandboxes like CodeSandbox or StackBlitz. These sandboxes provide a virtual environment where you can write and test your React code without having to install anything on your computer.

Vite
----

Online sandboxes aside, a popular choice is Vite, which is a build tool that provides a fast and easy development experience for modern web projects. Vite supports React out-of-the-box, which means that you can quickly set up a React project without having to configure the build process manually. Run the below command and follow the prompts!


```
npm create vite@latest
```
Next.js
-------


Another popular choice for getting started with React is Next.js, which is a framework built on top of React. Next.js provides a robust set of features, including automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, static site generation, and more. Next.js is great for building complex applications that require server-side rendering and SEO optimization. The easiest way to get started with Next.js is by using create-next-app. It is a CLI tool that enables you to quickly start building a new Next.js application, with everything set up for you.

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Routing
---------

Routing is an essential part of any modern web application, and there are many excellent routing libraries available to handle complex routing logic and create dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs).

React Router
------------

One of the most popular routing libraries for React is React Router. React Router provides a straightforward and declarative way to handle routing in your React application, so you can define routes and render different components based on the current URL.

Here's a sample code snippet to set up the root route and an /about route, each rendering different content:

```js
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <Link to="about">About Us</Link>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    path: "about",
    element: <div>About</div>,
  },
]);
```

TanStack Router
----------------

A new kid on the block is TanStack Router. It is feature rich and lightweight but has relatively smaller usage compared to React Router. If you come across a specific feature that is present only in TanStack Router, you might want to give this a try. Here‚Äôs a comparison table to help you make that decision.


Client state management
------------------------

As your application grows, it helps to be more intentional about how your state is organized and how the data flows between your components. State management libraries make it easier to manage complex application state and keep your UI in sync with your data.

Redux Toolkit
--------------


A popular state management library for React is Redux Toolkit. Redux Toolkit is a set of tools and best practices for efficiently managing state. It provides a simplified API for defining and updating state, as well as built-in support for features such as immutable updates, serializable action types, and more.

Redux Toolkit also includes a number of additional features, such as a built-in Thunk middleware for handling asynchronous logic, and a DevTools extension for debugging your Redux state.

Here‚Äôs a code snippet of a redux slice which is a collection of redux logic and actions for a single feature in your app:

```js
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const initialState = {
  value: 0,
}

export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
      state.value += action.payload
    },
  },
})

// Action creators are generated for each case reducer function
export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions

export default counterSlice.reducer
```

Zustand
--------


Zustand is another state management library for React that provides a clear and lightweight solution for managing state in your application. Zustand provides a built-in mechanism for subscribing to state changes, so you can easily keep your UI in sync with your data.

It is a great choice for developers who want a lightweight and easy-to-use state management solution without the overhead of a larger library like Redux.

Here is a code snippet for a simple increment counter using Zustand:

```js
import { create } from 'zustand'

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 1,
  inc: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
}))

function Counter() {
  const { count, inc } = useStore()

  return (
    <div>
      <span>{count}</span>
      <button onClick={inc}>one up</button>
    </div>
  )
}

```

Redux Toolkit for a more fully-featured solution with a larger API and built-in support for additional features.

Zustand for a lightweight and simple solution that is easy to use and doesn't require as much boilerplate code.

Server state management
-----------------------


Server state management refers to the management of data that is stored on the server and is accessed remotely by the client application. This data can include user authentication details, database records, and other backend data. To manage server state in React applications, there are several libraries available.

TanStack Query
---------------

The most popular one is TanStack Query which provides an intuitive and powerful way to manage server state in React applications. It provides a caching layer that automatically manages the state of your data, fetching and updating it as needed.

The library also provides a number of built-in features, such as automatic re-fetching, polling, and pagination, making it easy to work with complex data sets.

Here‚Äôs a sample code snippet of querying an API and working with the returned response in a function component:

```js
function GitHubStats() {
  const { isLoading, error, data, isFetching } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["repoData"],
    queryFn: () =>
      axios
        .get("https://api.github.com/repos/gopinav/react-query-tutorials")
        .then((res) => res.data),
  });

  if (isLoading) return "Loading...";

  if (error) return "An error has occurred: " + error.message;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.name}</h1>
      <p>{data.description}</p>
      <strong>üëÄ {data.subscribers_count}</strong>{" "}
      <strong>‚ú® {data.stargazers_count}</strong>{" "}
      <strong>üç¥ {data.forks_count}</strong>
      <div>{isFetching ? "Updating..." : ""}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

SWR
----


SWR is another popular library for managing server state in React applications. The name ‚ÄúSWR‚Äù comes from stale-while-revalidate, a cache invalidation strategy popularized by HTTP RFC 5861. Compared to TanStack Query, SWR does have some feature limitations.

If you‚Äôre using Redux Toolkit for client state management, Redux Toolkit Query is a great choice for seamlessly managing server state.

Apollo Client is another popular library for managing server state in React applications. It is particularly well-suited for working with GraphQL APIs.

Apollo Client for GraphQL
--------------------------


Form handling
--------------

Handling forms can be a tedious and error-prone task, but there are now many excellent form-handling libraries available for React. Some of the most popular options include Formik and React Hook Form. These libraries make it easier to handle form validation, submission, and error handling.

Formik
-------

While Formik provides an intuitive API for managing form state, validating inputs, and submitting data the library is not actively maintained.

React Hook Form
----------------

React Hook Form should be your go-to library for handling forms in 2023. It is lightweight, fast, and straightforward to use. React Hook Form utilizes the power of React hooks to manage form state and validation rules. It also provides a flexible API for building forms and allows you to easily integrate with other libraries such as Yup and Zod for validation.

Unlike Formik, React Hook Form does not require a lot of boilerplate code and can significantly reduce the amount of code needed to handle form data. Additionally, React Hook Form has excellent performance as the component does not re-render for every change in the field value.

Here‚Äôs a sample code snippet for a react hook form that accepts a user‚Äôs first and last names:

```js
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

export default function App() {
  const { register, handleSubmit, watch, formState: { errors } } = useForm();
  const onSubmit = data => console.log(data);

  return (
    /* "handleSubmit" will validate your inputs before invoking "onSubmit" */
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      {/* register your input into the hook by invoking the "register" function */}
      <input {...register("firstName")} />
      
      {/* include validation with required or other standard HTML validation rules */}
      <input {...register("lastName", { required: true })} />
      {/* errors will return when field validation fails  */}
      {errors.lastName && <span>This field is required</span>}
      
      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

React Hook Form with Yup/Zod for performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.

Testing

With CSS Modules, you can write CSS classes that are only applied to specific components, preventing naming collisions and ensuring that styles are properly encapsulated.

In the CSS Modules approach, you would need to create a separate CSS file ‚Äî for example, Button.module.css ‚Äî with the following content:

```js
import styles from './Button.module.css';

const Button = () => (
  <button className={styles.button}>
    Button
  </button>
);

export default Button;
.button {
  background-color: #3f51b5;
  color: #fff;
  font-weight: bold;
